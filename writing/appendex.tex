    """Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find shortest weighted paths
    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
    sources : non-empty iterable of nodes
        Starting nodes for paths. If this is just an iterable containing
        a single node, then all paths computed by this function will
        start from that node. If there are two or more nodes in this
        iterable, the computed paths may begin from any one of the start
        nodes.
    target : node label, optional
        Ending node for path. Search is halted when target is found.
    cutoff : integer or float, optional
        Depth to stop the search. Only return paths with length <= cutoff.
    Returns
    -------
    dist : dictionary
        A mapping from node to shortest distance to that node from one
        of the source nodes.
    next_node : tuple
        The first node, n, the search finds that is one level below the current node
        i.e. d_p(n) = lev - 1
    paths: dictionary
        dict to store the path list from source to each node, keyed by node.
    Notes
    -----
    The optional predecessor and path dictionaries can be accessed by
    the caller through the original pred and paths objects passed
    as arguments. No need to explicitly return pred or paths.
